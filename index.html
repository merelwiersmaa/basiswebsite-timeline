						<h3>Origine:</h3> <!-- Van: https://goldenagecomics.fandom.com/wiki/Joker#:~:text=Joker%20of%20Earth%2DTwo%20is,Golden%20Age%20of%20Comic%20Books.-->
						<p>He first gained attention in early 1940 when he was operating as a masked professional criminal leader known as the Red Hood. The Red Hood and his men attempted to rob a profitable manufacturing business adjacent to a chemical processing plant. Batman and Robin arrived on the scene and the Red Hood escaped by running through the chemical plant. He was left with little choice but to dive into a large vat of steaming chemicals. According on one printing of the Joker's origin, the chemicals were the inks used to make playing cards. Batman and Robin naturally assumed that their adversary died being exposed to the heated toxic chemicals. </p>
						<p>The Red Hood actually survived the chemical bath and managed to escape through a drainage pipe that emptied out into the river. However when he emerged from the waste pipes, he discovered that the chemicals turned his hair green, his skin chalk-white and his lips rouge red. Driven partially insane from the experience, the criminal decided to pattern himself after the playing cards Joker character that the chemicals were used to create. Soon after his recreation and new name, the Joker quickly became a noted criminal entity in Gotham City's criminal underground.</p>

						<h3>Cesar Romero</h3> <!-- Van: https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Joker_(Batman_1966_TV_Series) -->
						<p>The 1966 Batman series's incarnation of the Joker marked the first time that the character was depicted in non-comics media; live action. Romero's energy, shrieking laugh, and many creative deathtraps left a powerful impression on many audiences at the time, and continues to be remembered fondly even today, decades after the series had ended. Even the mustache that remained visible on Romero's face during Batman's filming has achieved a certain level of fame, becoming accepted by many as the most recognizable element of this particular incarnation of the Joker.</p>
						<p>Though Romero was nearly sixty at the time, he was offered the role of the Joker, he infused the role with a powerful enthusiasm. Romero refused to shave his mustache for the role of the Joker, even though the character had always been (and still is) portrayed as clean-shaven in the comics. As a result, the makeup that Romero wore to imitate the Joker's chalk-white skin tone was applied directly over the mustache, leaving the mustache partially visible during filming.
						   Romero would later go on to state that the wig bothered him more than any other part of the Joker's costume, as it was glued to his forehead and tended to give him headaches.</p>

						<h3>Jack Napier</h3> <!-- Van: https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/The_Joker_(Burtonverse)-->
						<p>Born in Brooklyn, Jack Napier came to live in Gotham City. In his school years, Jack proved himself to be emotionally unstable, but was highly intelligent, and showed aptitude in art, science and chemistry. He also turned to a life of violent crime. When he was fifteen, Jack was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. He also implied that he may have also murdered people, including his own parents, since he was a kid. Napier also got into a sadistic habit of asking his victims whether they "danced with the Devil in/by the pale moonlight" before he shot them.</p>
						<p>Jack started off as a man with black hair and a Caucasian complexion and wore business suits with black shoes, a black trench-coat, a matching fedora and black gloves. After his transformation into the Joker, both his hair and fingernails were changed to emerald green, his skin became chalk-white and his lips were flushed ruby-red. Ricocheted shrapnel from a bullet had severed the nerves in his cheeks and after a botched plastic surgery attempt to repair them, left him with a permanent rictus grin. Though he would occasionally apply himself with various cosmetic products to give himself a more normal-looking skin tone and hair color that resembled his original appearance.</p>

						<h3>Jack Napier, but animated</h3> <!-- Van: https://batmantheanimatedseries.fandom.com/wiki/Joker -->
						<p>Voiced by Mark Hamill, after becoming the crazy criminal and mob boss known as Joker, he started perpetrating crimes with the sole purpose of creating chaos. He would also give to himself multiple fake tragic backstories to convince people to have sympathy and working for him. As a recurrent patient of Arkham Asylum, the Joker psycho-analyzed by Dr. Harleen Quinzel. After one session, the Joker fooled Dr. Quinzel as he painted himself as a misunderstood soul crying out for the world to accept him. Quinzel soon found herself in love with the Joker, and broke him out of Arkham.</p>
						<p>Regardless of the state of his seriously twisted mind, The Joker was a brilliant planner, and never appeared to run out of schemes. Often, The Joker's plans were connected to humor and were extremely perilous which resulted in him being dreaded wherever his schemes took him. The Joker could lie effortlessly and was remarkably accomplished at making up heart-rending stories that were capable of deceiving people into believing that he was simply misinterpreted, or in Harley Quinn's case, essentially taking pity on him and making her determined to help him in any way possible.</p>
